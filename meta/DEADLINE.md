## Part 1: App Description

Asteroids Redux is a remake of the original Asteroids arcade game. Shoot and dodge the asteroids to survive and gain 
score. Asteroids will split into pieces, with smaller peices being worth more points. 
Occasionally, you will encounter a large saucer that shoots randomly as well as a small saucer that shoots at you 
and gets increasingly more accurate as your score gets higher. Press the Shift button to go into hyperspace, which
teleports you to a new random location, but be careful, as you may teleport into a more dangerous situation! You gain 1
health every 5000 points, and you lose 1 health every time you hit an asteroid or a saucer's bullet. The game gets more
difficult as your score increases and continues until you run out of health.

### Scoring

> Tiny: 100 points \
> Small: 50 points \
> Medium: 20 points \
> Large: 10 points

##### Saucers
> Small: 1000 points \

## Part 2: New

I learned a lot about how to use vectors to calculate collisions and positions. Also, using
the JavaFX AnimationPlayer to create a gameloop was interesting and I learned a lot about game development in general.
I now realize how using an engine like Unity can speed up development significantly.

## Part 3: Retrospect

I would plan out my project first instead of learning and restructuring as I go. I would also structure my project in a 
way that would allow me to easily add more features such as a high-score system and weapon power-ups. Also, if this
was a project that I would want to release publicly, I would use more personally authored assets.
